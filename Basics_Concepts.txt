#this is the list of RHCSA exam 200 objective which can be practiced outside of red hat linux 
#meaning you do not need red hat linux instead you jut need [linux] i am currently using a debian based MX linux to prepare for basics which are like 

You can practice many general Linux system administration concepts on a Debian-based system (like Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04, or Linux Mint), but you must be careful.

The RHCSA is a "performance-based" exam, meaning you must solve problems the "Red Hat way." Since Debian uses different core subsystems (APT instead of DNF, AppArmor instead of SELinux), practicing solely on Debian **will cause you to fail specific sections** of the exam.

Below is the breakdown of which objectives are **Safe** (Universal Linux) and which are **Unsafe** (Red Hat Specific) to practice on Debian.

### 1. Safe to Practice on Debian (Universal Linux Skills)

*These tasks function nearly identically on Debian (Bash, Systemd, and GNU tools are standard), making them safe to practice.*

* **Understand and use essential tools:**
* Access a shell prompt and issue commands.
* Use input-output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `|`).
* Use `grep` and regular expressions.
* Access remote systems using SSH.
* Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files (`tar`, `gzip`, `bzip2`).
* Create and edit text files (`vim`, `nano`).
* Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories.
* Create hard and soft links (`ln`).
* List, set, and change standard ugo/rwx permissions (`chmod`, `chown`).
* Locate, read, and use system documentation (`man`).


* **Create simple shell scripts:**
* All scripting objectives are safe. Bash scripting is universal.
* (Conditionals, Loops, Parameters `$1`, Processing output).RHCSA_


* **Manage Users and Groups:**
* Create, delete, and modify local user accounts (`useradd`, `usermod`).
* Create, delete, and modify local groups (`groupadd`, `groupmod`).
* Change passwords and adjust aging (`passwd`, `chage`).
* Configure privileged access (`sudo` configuration in `/etc/sudoers.d/`).


* **Configure Local Storage & File Systems:**
* *Note: You may need to install `lvm2` and `xfsprogs` on Debian first.*
* List, create, delete partitions on GPT disks (`fdisk`, `gdisk`).
* Create/remove physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes (`pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate`).
* Create, mount, unmount VFAT, ext4, and XFS file systems.
* Mount file systems by UUID (editing `/etc/fstab`).
* Diagnose and correct file permission problems.



### 2. Risky / "install-required" on Debian (Proceed with Caution)

*These work on Debian, but the tools are not installed by default or the configuration file paths differ.*

* **Operate running systems:**
* *Start, stop, and check status of network services:* Safe, as both use `systemctl`, but service names differ (e.g., `apache2` on Debian vs `httpd` on Red Hat).
* *Locate and interpret system logs:* Safe (`journalctl` is standard), but log file locations differ (`/var/log/auth.log` on Debian vs `/var/log/secure` on Red Hat).
* *Configure time service clients:* Debian uses `systemd-timesyncd` by default; Red Hat uses `chronyd`. You would need to explicitly install `chrony` on Debian to practice.


* **Manage basic networking:**
* *Configure IPv4/IPv6:* Debian uses `ifupdown` or `Netplan` by default. Red Hat uses **NetworkManager** (`nmcli`).
* *Fix:* You *can* install NetworkManager on Debian and use `nmcli`, but it is not the default experience.



### 3. DO NOT Practice on Debian (Red Hat Specifics)

*The software stack here is fundamentally different. Practicing these on Debian is useless for the exam.*

* **❌ Manage software (The biggest difference):**
* *Objective:* Install/remove RPM packages, Configure RPM repositories.
* *Why:* Debian uses `.deb` and `apt`. Red Hat uses `.rpm` and `dnf`/`rpm`. You cannot practice `dnf` repository management on Debian.


* **❌ Manage security (SELinux):**
* *Objective:* Set enforcing/permissive modes, Manage SELinux file contexts/port labels.
* *Why:* Debian uses **AppArmor** by default. While you *can* install SELinux on Debian, it is complex and behaves differently than the "out-of-the-box" Red Hat policy. You need a Red Hat system to practice troubleshooting SELinux contexts correctly.


* **❌ Manage security (Firewall):**
* *Objective:* Configure firewall settings using `firewall-cmd`.
* *Why:* Debian often defaults to `ufw` or raw `nftables`. Red Hat uses `firewalld`.


* **❌ Interrupt the boot process / Modify bootloader:**
* *Why:* The procedure to reset a root password involves editing GRUB. The paths (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` vs `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`) and the command to rebuild grub (`update-grub` vs `grub2-mkconfig`) are different.



### 4. Which Debian version matches RHEL 10 software versions?
RHCSA_
If you want the closest software version match to **RHEL 10** (which is based on Fedora 40/41 era technology):

* **Use: Debian 13 "Trixie" (currently Debian Testing).**
* **Why:** RHEL 10 uses Kernel 6.12+, GNOME 47, and Python 3.12.
* **Debian 12 (Stable)** is too old (Kernel 6.1, Python 3.11).
* **Debian Testing** is currently on Kernel 6.x and Python 3.12+, which aligns much closer to the RHEL 10 runtime environment for scripting and tool versions.
